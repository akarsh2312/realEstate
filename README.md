Summary

Full-Stack Architecture & Modern Technologies: Engineered a scalable real estate web application leveraging the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), incorporating Prisma for streamlined database interaction, JWT for secure authentication, and Context API for efficient state management.

Real-Time Communication: Integrated Socket.io to enable real-time chat functionality, allowing users (buyers, sellers, agents) to seamlessly communicate within the platform, enhancing user engagement and facilitating faster property transactions.

Robust Frontend Experience: Developed a dynamic and user-friendly frontend using React, React Router Dom for navigation, and Context API for global state management. Implemented features like property listings, search/filtering, detailed property views, and interactive map integrations.

Secure Backend & Data Management: Built a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js to handle data requests and authentication. Utilized MongoDB as the database, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval, and implemented JWT-based authentication to protect user data and secure sensitive actions.
